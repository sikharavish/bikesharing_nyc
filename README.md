# BikeSharing Proposal – Des Moines

## Overview

### This project was creating visualizations for a proposal to open a Bike Sharing company in Des Moines.  To complete this I used data from CitiBike in NYC and Tableau to show the final results.  The data was broken down and displayed in various charts to show who uses the bikes, how often and the duration of rentals.  This information was put together in a clear story backed up by the data so an informed decision came be made on how to make this new business successful.

## Results

### The data focused on rental information for August.  The initial [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bike_Sharing_Dashboard/NYCCitiBike?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) created showed there were 2.3 million rides taken, primarily by men with over 1.5 million.  There were just over 1.9 million subscribers and 443 thousand customers.  The majority of trips started and ended in Manhattan.

## Summary

### The data showed that the heaviest rental traffic took place Monday – Friday between the hours of 8am and 7pm in Manhattan.  The top starting and ending locations are very similar as well.  This suggests that many customers/subscribers use them to get to and from work.  Thursday was the busiest day and Sunday was the slowest. 

### There are a few visualizations I would suggest to get a clearer picture of this business.  The first is looking at the different seasons, particularly winter.  The data we analyzed was from August when it is very warm, but how does the colder weather affect how often people rent the bikes.  We should repeat the Total trip data, Customer vs Subscriber, Peak Hours and Trips by weekday per hour during December.  In addition, we could choose March or April for spring, and October for Fall.  The second visualization would be to examine the ratio between bike rental stations and/or bikes available to population of the neighborhood it is located in.  Is there an opportunity to get more people to rent by adding more bikes in certain areas?  A more informed decision can be made with these additional charts to show the whole picture.
